# Servatrice-PHP-Bridge
This PHP class is a bridge between PHP scripts and servatrice. It will eventually contain every function and features that are required to run and interface a Cockatrice Server from PHP. 

This will not be a self contained website, but more a class that can be used by websites to implement their own control panel. Basic webpages here serve only as example and should not be used in a production enviroment.

This will be built slow overtime as a lot of features are required. Hoping to achive minium one new function a week.
